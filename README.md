# linux-setup

## What is the purpose of this script?

The `setup.sh` script in this repository is used to set up debian-based and fedora linux desktops. I use these this script when setting up a new distro.

## Usage

Clone this repository anywhere on your Linux system (I usually put it in the `/home` directory)

Give the script permission to run with the command `chmod +x setup.sh` and run it with `sudo ./setup.sh`
